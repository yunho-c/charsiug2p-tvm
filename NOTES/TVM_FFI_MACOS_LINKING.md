macOS Flutter build now copies `libtvm_ffi.dylib` and `libtvm_ffi_testing.dylib` from `tvm-ffi-config --libdir` into `${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}` and the framework’s `Frameworks` folder during `flutter/cargokit/build_pod.sh`, declares them as script outputs in `flutter/macos/charsiug2p_flutter.podspec`, and links them dynamically with runpaths set to `@loader_path/Frameworks` and `@executable_path/../Frameworks` so TVM-FFI symbols resolve when linking `libcharsiug2p_g2p_ffi.a`.
