## Project instructions

- Use `py -3.12` (it should have TVM installed).
- Prefix commit messages with one of: `feat:`, `docs:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `misc:`.
- Write important information in `NOTES` so we can reference later.
- Use Context7 to read TVM/MLC-LLM docs whenever needed.
- The source code for TVM is in `external/tvm`, and TVM-FFI is in `external/tvm/3rdparty/tvm-ffi` - feel free to read it.
- Do not add newlines solely for line length in markdown; prefer natural paragraph wrapping.
